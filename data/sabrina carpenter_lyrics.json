She picks it up and goes to slam it against the window.\n\nMAN: Reset, reset, no, no, no!\n\nShe stops at the last moment. Cut to her taking off her \"Cindy Lou Who\" dress. Part of it remains wrapped around her legs.\n\nSABRINA: Well, we should do that one more time!\n\nShe laughs. Cut to another take. She trips and cries out as she tries to take a step.

"Seventeen June 2017 Interview", "lyrics": "2 ContributorsSeventeen June 2017 Interview LyricsSabrina Carpenter's fans were so bummed when her Disney Channel show Girl Meets World got cancelled at the end of its third season early this year, but there's definitely one silver lining: Sabrina's been able to concentrate on her music! \"Ever since the show wrapped, I've been very lucky that I've been able to focus on music and give it all of my attention,\" Sabrina told Seventeen.com in an interview.\n\nActually, she's so focused on music that she's about to kick off her second headlining tour in July called The De-Tour. But before that, she's going to be opening for Ariana Grande on her Dangerous Woman tour for two nights in Brazil — two concert stops that will go on as planned despite Ariana suspending her tour after the tragic bombing that took place after her concert in Manchester, England last month.\n\nWe got the chance to chat with Sabrina and she opened up about the One Love Manchester Tribute concert, how she feels about fans shipping her with former tour-mate and Vamps singer Bradley Simpson, and — most importantly — all the deets on her tour!\n\nSO YOU'RE GOING ON TOUR WITH ARIANA GRANDE AT THE END OF THE MONTH IN BRAZIL. HOW DID YOU FEEL WATCHING HER ONE LOVE MANCHESTER TRIBUTE CONCERT?\n\n\"It was incredible how they handled it. That will be the show of the year. I kept saying to my mom — because I was watching with her and obviously it was really emotional because I think as happy as the event was, it was still heartbreaking to watch — the way that they were able to take a tragic situation and turn it into something that brought us closer together just shows you how powerful music is and how we are all there for each other at the end of the day. It restored my faith a little seeing all these people coming together in such a loving way. It made me really happy to be a part of this time in music right now.\"\n\nWHAT SURPRISES CAN FANS EXPECT TO SEE WHEN THEY GO TO THE DE-TOUR?\n\n\"This is my second headline tour and anything that can be different will be different. It's a very new experience. I tried to make it into a musical journey so you're going hear songs from Eyes Wide Open and you're going to hear songs from Evolution. Aesthetically, I want to it feel like I'm taking you on a detour. It's going to be a party more than anything, which is how it should be.\n\n\"The coolest thing about doing live shows is I'm able to give the songs a new life. So even thought they're old, I'm able to do them in a way that's modern. I'll be doing that a lot and messing around with the arrangements and just making it something unique.\"\n\nYOU WERE JUST ON TOUR WITH THE VAMPS AND GOT THE CHANCE TO PERFORM WITH THEM A TON. FANS HAVE STARTED SHIPPING YOU WITH BRADLEY SIMPSON. DOES SEEING THAT STUFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAKE THINGS AWKWARD?\n\n\"We completely ignore it. For me, first of all, I didn't know about all this. Bradley also isn't on social media very much. I think we just try to live in reality as much as we can.\"\n\nWHAT'S ONE SONG OF YOURS THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET SICK OF?\n\n\"I don't know if I will ever get sick of performing a song called 'Feels Like Loneliness' from Evolution. It's inspired by one of my favorite songs, 'Fever' by Peggy Lee.

It has a new sound to it for sure.\"\n\nARE YOU STILL CLOSE WITH YOUR \"GIRL MEETS WORLD\" CASTMATES?\n\n\"Absolutely. We're always trying to get together but, unfortunately, we're always all over the world. I guess it's good because we're all meeting the world. Oh my gosh — I didn't say that. But I did.\"\n\nCAN WE EXPECT TO SEE YOU ON OUR TV SCREENS IN THE FUTURE?\n\n\"Right now, my focus is on music. I want to be able to see the world and meet fans everywhere. I think that's the priority for me and I literally couldn't be doing anything else right now. So I want to make sure my fans know that and make sure they are seen and that they are heard. But then we have some special things coming. Things are definitely in the works but I'm not going to give too much away because that takes the surprise out of everything.\"Embed\nSabrina Carpenter's fans were so bummed when her Disney Channel show Girl Meets World got cancelled at the end of its third season early this year, but there's definitely one silver lining: Sabrina's been able to concentrate on her music! \"Ever since the show wrapped, I've been very lucky that I've been able to focus on music and give it all of my attention,\" Sabrina told Seventeen.com in an interview.\n\nActually, she's so focused on music that she's about to kick off her second headlining tour in July called The De-Tour. But before that, she's going to be opening for Ariana Grande on her Dangerous Woman tour for two nights in Brazil — two concert stops that will go on as planned despite Ariana suspending her tour after the tragic bombing that took place after her concert in Manchester, England last month.\n\nWe got the chance to chat with Sabrina and she opened up about the One Love Manchester Tribute concert, how she feels about fans shipping her with former tour-mate and Vamps singer Bradley Simpson, and — most importantly — all the deets on her tour!\n\nSO YOU'RE GOING ON TOUR WITH ARIANA GRANDE AT THE END OF THE MONTH IN BRAZIL. HOW DID YOU FEEL WATCHING HER ONE LOVE MANCHESTER TRIBUTE CONCERT?\n\n\"It was incredible how they handled it. That will be the show of the year. I kept saying to my mom — because I was watching with her and obviously it was really emotional because I think as happy as the event was, it was still heartbreaking to watch — the way that they were able to take a tragic situation and turn it into something that brought us closer together just shows you how powerful music is and how we are all there for each other at the end of the day. It restored my faith a little seeing all these people coming together in such a loving way. It made me really happy to be a part of this time in music right now.\"\n\nWHAT SURPRISES CAN FANS EXPECT TO SEE WHEN THEY GO TO THE DE-TOUR?\n\n\"This is my second headline tour and anything that can be different will be different. It's a very new experience. I tried to make it into a musical journey so you're going hear songs from Eyes Wide Open and you're going to hear songs from Evolution. Aesthetically, I want to it feel like I'm taking you on a detour. It's going to be a party more than anything, which is how it should be.\n\n\"The coolest thing about doing live shows is I'm able to give the songs a new life. So even thought they're old, I'm able to do them in a way that's modern. I'll be doing that a lot and messing around with the arrangements and just making it something unique.\"\n\nYOU WERE JUST ON TOUR WITH THE VAMPS AND GOT THE CHANCE TO PERFORM WITH THEM A TON.
