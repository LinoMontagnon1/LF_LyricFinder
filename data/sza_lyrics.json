gave it all up for him\nNever even pushed for the pussy\nWhere's Forrest now when you need him?\nTalk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey\n\n[Chorus: SZA]\nAttention, all you niggas, all you bitches\nSit

let's amen to that\nI mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks\nAnd the screw face when the bae look\nWon't get you no pussy\nI mean, the fake chains and the code names\nFor insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy (You not to get)\nYou overcompensate too much for the pussy\nYou like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy\nSee, that's what pussy niggas do\nI know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you\nHow many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?\nHow many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?\nHow many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?\nBut if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you\nSolána, middle fingers up, speak your truth\nYou might also like[Verse 3: SZA]\nYou could never trivialize pussy\nBut a bum nigga like you would try it

could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya\n(Such a nice girl, SZA)\nI'm really tryna crack off on the headboard\nAnd bust it wide open for the right one\nIs you that for me?\n'Cause if

heart swore\nI pour plenty more semen, or explore cunnilingus\nDummy tore through that boy for pointing fingers\nHoney you're a PS4, my game change seasons\nAnd my name explain visas, I defame your name easy\nWe aim and keep squeezing, bitch my lane say no treason\nMy chains say no cubic, all y'all look stupid (stupid!)\nBig dog, three phone call log stupid (stupid!)\nI'm Chris Paul, West Coast, All-Star stupid!\nThe mantra, the holy trinity, baby your sponsor\nMy concert and your facility, via del Compton\nAnd Watt's finest!\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nNow this that big shell fishscale\nBMX on the ramp with the fishtail\nPegs on the front, we gon' get there\nWe four deep at a swap meet, don't need a 5th wheel\nThis bitch steal whoever if situations get real\nThis that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles\nGet buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle\nShow your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)\nAnd show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus\nRollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock\nGotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock\nGotta do what I do to remain on\nSo all a nigga need is good love when I come home\nCause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately\nAnd I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too crazy\nFugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet\nGive you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed\nI'm the silver

breathe\nI know perception is key, so I am king\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]\nThe other side has never mortified my mortal mind\nThe borderline between insanity is Father Time\nI fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind\nI know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died\nCarpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise\nA tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite\nA couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify\nBut couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice\nI'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith\nGenocism and capitalism just made me hate\nCorrectionals and these private prisons gave me a date\nProfessional dream killers reason why I'm awake\nI'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place\nReinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes\nBefore I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?\nOr this is just a mirage or a facade\nWait"}, {"title": "untitled 07 | 2014-2016", "lyrics": "282

worry\nStuttering and shaken out of fear\nBeauty's never given in a hurry\nSo condescending, leave your questions here\nHey, glory child, don't you worry\nI can see your skeleton so clear\nDoubting's only made your visions blurry\nYou're better off just looking in the mirror\n\n[Chorus]\nShow me a better way, I wish you could\nShow me a better way, I wish you would\nCome home today\nYou could come home today\n\n[Verse 2]\nI am shooting stars, don't you see me?\nWatching over your every mistake\nDigging out of graves is never easy\nHanding you my shovel here to take\nAlways playing catch-me-if-you-can\nGingerbread—you heard I'm sweet to taste\nClose your eyes, let go, and count to ten\nI'll keep track of every moment wasted\n\n[Chorus]\nShow me a better way, I wish you could\nShow me a better way, I wish you would\nCome home today\nYou could come home today\n\n[Part 2]\n\n[Intro: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]\nDear God, make me a bird\nSo I can fly far, far, far away\nDear
