Diggy Simmons]\nYou got weapons of mass seduction\nIf I was broke I’d give you half of nothing\nOr give it all then I'd give you more\nI’m no decorator but the writing’s on the wall\nWinter, summer, fall, April, May and June\nYou shot me through the heart but I don’t have a wound\nYou got a good aim cause I could’ve sworn I moved\nWhen it comes to relationships I don’t have a clue\nLove at first sight I don’t know I zoom\nYou put a hit on me ba da bing, ba da boom\nIf this is pain let me hurry up and suffer\nWhat doesn’t kill me should make my love tougher\nI’m tough now, wassup now?\nFire at me, I swear I won’t duck down\nWow, you had me in awe\nYou ain’t have to shoot girl you had me from your draw\n\n[Chorus: Bruno Mars (& Diggy Simmons)]\nYou shot me through the heart starin' in your eyes (your eyes)\nSo I might die a happy man today (today)\nJust empty out your barrel, girl\nIt’s alright (haha)\nClick clack away (click clack away)\nClick clack away (click clack away)\nGo ‘head

very breath\nCall 911 Mary, Clef\nNo need to ask if I’m ready, yes\nI go get my tux and you go get your dress\nAnd we gon’ do it big although we just met\nI was just being fresh, yeah, I know I’m a mess\nBut I like spontaneity, continuity\nLet it flow let it flow just you and me\nAnd I’m not pressin' charges\nDon’t want you to ricochet and hit another target\nYou take me to the edge, right up to the margin\nAll I see is fireworks, I can feel it sparkin'\nHope you keep me at the center of your bullseye\nAnd you know it’s more benefits or full time\nYou are everything and more\nYou ain’t have to shoot, girl, you had me from your draw\n\n[Chorus: Bruno Mars (& Diggy Simmons)]\nYou shot me through the heart starin' in your eyes (your eyes)\nSo I might die a happy man today (today)\nJust

I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice\nLove is thinking about others before you think about yourself\nLove is selfless not selfish.
