I know, I know, I know, I know you want me\nYou're just a pig inside a human body!\nSquealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting\nYou're just a pig inside!\nLET’S GO PARIS!\nSwine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!\nSwine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!\nSwine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!\nSwine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!\n\n[Drop]\nOh, I don’t feel so good. I might be sick, I might throw up\nPut your f* hands up Paris!  Now jump!\nSWINEEEE!!!! YEEEAHHH!!!!\nARTRAVEE!!!!\nSWINE!\n\n*takes wig off*\nSWINE !\n\nJUMP PARIS ! LETS GOO ! *shake towel everywhere*\n\n[Outro]\nSWINEEE!!!!! *breathes* YEEAAAAH!!!!\n\n-gyspy-\n\n*plays piano*\nI hope that you always remember this time in our lives together\nWhen we painted each others faces, and called each other monsters. And talked about love, and art, all night long\nEvery year, when I travel around the world, I always wonder if things will be different. Maybe one year you won’t come to the show. Or you’ll be less festive or, not dressed up or, something different\nBut what I realised, during ARTPOP, is that we belong together and some stories have no end\nI will follow you, around the world, as long as you have me\nBecause I love making music, I love making art. And I love, love meeting all of you beautiful creative people\nWhen this song is over, the clock will start ticking, until… the next time\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes a story has no end\nSometimes I think that we could just be friends..\n\"'Cause I'm a wandering man,\" he said to me\n\"And what about the future plans?\nDoes this thing we have even makes sense?\nWhen I got the whole world in front of me?\"\n\nI appreciate you so much. Thank you for believing in, in me always. I’ll always believe in you\nWhen I die, they’ll say: “Lady Gaga was special. But her fans, her monsters, they were really something.”\n\n[Chorus 1]\nSo, I said...\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gcpsy life\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nMaybe we can see the world together\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nTaylor, im coming home! *smile*\nBut I can be..\nCOME ON!!\nTonight!\nTonight!\n\n[Verse 2]\nPUT YOUR HANDS UP !\nSo I just packed my baggage, and\nSaid goodbye to family and friends\nAnd took a road to nowhere on my own\nLike Dorothy on a yellow brick\nHope my ruby shoes get us there quick\n'Cause I left everyone I love at home!\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nMaybe we can see the world together\nI don't wanna be alone forever, But I can be WITH PARIS TONIIIIIIGHT!!!\n\n\nPut your hands up for DJ White Shadow, DJ Zedd, and Red One\nAnd we can't forget Billy, and all of you ! I lcve you so much! *claps*\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd then he asked me, he said\n\"Baby, why do we love each other?\"\nI said, \"Honey, it's simple !\nIt's the way that you love and treat your mother.\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight\nI'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life\nAnd you'll be my little gcpsy princess\nPack your bags and we can chase the sunset\nBust the rearview and PARIS\n'Cause it's you and me\nEVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER COME ON!! *sings* BABY FOR LIFEEE!!!!\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm\n\n[Outro]\nRussia, UK, Paris\nI'm Italian, Asian kompai\nAfrica, India, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy\nI'm Latin-American\nI don't speak German, but I try\nSomeday in Jakarta\nI'm American, I'm gcpsy\nI'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia\nSweden, Finland, Norway\nBe my home just for the day\nI'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy\nHey...\n\nThank you so much!

changed my face\nI've changed my name but no one wants you when you lose\n\n[Chorus: Lady Gaga]\nDon't give up 'cause you have friends\nDon't give up\nYou're not beaten yet\nDon't give up\nI know you

Cherub, staring me in the eye\nThen remember when we shot a scene in that foam bathtub\nI was just a little mermaid, in the arms of your love\nAriel has got her prince and now they're both drinking beer\nLiving life above the water, no octopus to fear\nIt's kinda like I woke up in a Disney dream\nBut then I got real high and I became the queen\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]\nI wanna kiss you, you're so far away, I missed you\nBut it will be so worth it when we'll make it, honey\nIt's been a whole month, but babe, I missed you so much\nBut it will be so worth it when you get up on me\n\n[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Matthew Koma]\n'Cause your eyes say things that you never say\nAnd sweat commits through my skin like rain\nI'm better off without makeup when she comes\nWhen she comes, oh, when she comes\n\n[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Matthew Koma, Matthew Koma]\nHalle-ha-hallelu-hallelujah (Come)\nHalle-ha-hallelu-hallelujah (She comes)\nHalle-hallelu-hallelujah\nEverybody say it, but I know how

Since we've all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I can't help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let's all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they're fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community.
