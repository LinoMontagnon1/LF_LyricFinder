that girl last night\nWhy did I choose to go through it again\n\nWhen will I finally say enough is enough\n\nEnough is enough\nWhy does the poison taste like medicine\n\nI love everything that hates me\nAlcohol and cigarettes\nPromiscuous girls wanna date me\nBut only for a night and then a day of regrets\n\nEating sushi\nIn the center at the top of the pyramid\nThis is the life\nPoint blank period\nYou might also likeHamachi ahi\nUni unagi\nWe eat everything\nUp until the last big fish in all the 7 seas\n\n7 seas 7 sins at the table gambling’\nWash it all down with all green everything\nGreen dollars green grass green eyes green tea\nFrom poor to rich tables turn lights switch look how the pendulum swings\n\nIt's 113 degrees here in Sin City\nCan we at least admit that something's wrong\nThe mass media is an encyclopedia of trivial distractions\nSame old dance and song\n\nWho cares about a couple of convicts or the size of Lebron's d!ck\nWe're all lost at sea and can't see the coming storm\n\nA night was had dancing music flirting new friends\nWe're all in it together a glorious moment with people from all over the world\n\nWe were on top of the world\nSurfin on a rocket on cloud 9 with some fine felines\nBumping beats with a pocket full of sunshine\nFlashing lights and flashy ladies\nDrinks on me\nNo, literally, \"drink's on me.”\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 2: Top of The Pyramid\n\nEating sushi in the center at the top of the pyramid\nThis is the life point blank pyramid\nBuilt on the back of high hopes and low self esteem\nWhere every game is fixed and sits upon a million broken dreams\n\nSee\nI've seen a man lose everything due to his greed\nIn the passionate pursuit of his wants\nHe seemed to have lost all his necessary needs\n\nSee\nThis is Vegas baby\nWhere bad things seem good\nAnd good things seem shady\n\nThough luckily\nI've mastered the art of the sin\nSo I rarely play\nAnd when I do I play to win\n\nLoaded dice cards up my sleeve\nI know the dealer plus I paid off the magician\nFor I am one of those that made it\nTo the top of the pyramid\nSo now I sit in a penthouse suite with a sweet freak between my sheets at the Luxor\nI told you before this is the life point blank pyramid\n\nHahahahaha\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps\n\nCalifornia draught Texas floods\nPossessive lust disguised as love\nDisgusted but what can any of us do about it\nThe truth is we've got to stop talking and be about it\n\nAnd that is the fundamental problem\n\nPlus Luciferian false prophets profess hedonistic linguistics\nOn various obsolete topics\nAs artificial mystics with marketable gimmicks\nBreak the rules and the lines of scrimmage\n\nThis is serious in all seriousness\n\nStill we try to ignore it all and fill in the hole with alcohol and other various intoxicants\n\nThat is the elephant in the room\nWe are all consumers consumed\nWe are slaves that dig our own graves\nAnd build our own tombs\n\nWe can Tivo a TV show and that can be saved\nBut we can not seem to save our own souls\nMy heart has some holes\n\nNo clouds in LA just that ominous haze\n113 degrees in the shade\nAs the Luciferian prophets are praised\nAnd we don't care about the world as long as we're getting paid\n\nOnly when the last tree has died\nThe last river has been poisoned\nAnd the last fish has been caught\nWill we realize we can't eat money\n\nAnd we know all of this deep within ourselves\nThat's why we feel uneasy and anxious\nBecause we have no one left to blame but ourselves\n\nSo we log onto Facebook\nSearching for some kind of company and salvation\nSome words to guide us and pass the time\nSome voyeuristic advice and definitive direction\n\nBut the revolution won't be televised\nOnline on the internet what do we really find\nJust words and some pictures\nHumankind homogenized\n\nAnd infidel idols idolized\nWhile copycat killers copyright what was one ritualized\nAnd what's left of Mother Nature becomes industrialized\nHot as Hell still the temperature continues to rise\n\nIt's 113 degrees here in Sin City\nCan we at least admit that something's wrong\nThe mass media is an encyclopedia of trivial distractions\nSame old dance and song\n\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps!\n\nWill anyone go with me?\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 3: Exodus\n\nI came to this country to escape Hollywood\nWhere I was trapped in its trapped trappings\n\nTrapped in its clubs\nTrapped in its women\nTrapped in its drugs\nTrapped in its cliches\n\nSo why is it I find myself on the other side of the world\nAt a club with some women on drugs trapped in the same cliches?\n\nSame sh!t different country\n\nI guess you can take boy outta LA\nBut you can’t take the LA outta the boy\n\nI am the world’s first American refugee\n\nExcept I didn’t come on a boat in ragged clothes clinging to my body\nAnd ragged hopes clinging to my psyche\nI came on a plane in a 1st class seat\nDining on offering of a corporate world wide empire\n\nBut it is not the means of a movement\nIt is the intentions behind the actions that matter\n\nAnd I came with the intentions to create a healthier life\nA cleaner life\nA better future for myself and all those that I love\n\nI am an American Refugee\nI am an American Refugee\nFleeing the subconscious oppressions of my country\nFleeing the persecutions of all things I hold holy and sacred\n\nI am tired of witnessing the spiritual martyr of my failing comrades\n\nI am an American Refugee more specifically a Hollywood refugee\nFleeing the bright lights and large egos\nSearching for solace and refuge\nAmongst the towering rainforest trees of New Zealand\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 4: Love Sex Magic\n\nAs I soak my bruised bones and my blood diamonds\nIn a bubble bath of passionfruit and guava\nThis is no joke I exude the good life without even trying\nMy karma mixed with my commas brought me to Nirvana\n\nNo Kurt Cobain\nJust hurt and pain mixed up with this money made me a monster\nNo Meek Mills or weak wills\nJust a Student from School of Hard Knocks who graduated with honors\n\nSomehow\nSo now I’m swimming in endorphins with a princess no tiara\nNo tomorrow no time to borrow\nAnd I bet we’re gonna make Love Sex Magic no Future or Ciara\n\nThat’s a pop reference if you didn’t get it\nYeah Future Ciara I Bet Love Sex Magic trick or treat\n\nSee there’s a ton of puns\nAnd subliminals in almost every line I write\nSometimes the sublime subliminals are so subtle\nThat I don’t even catch them they escape no alibis\n\nCopycat killers can imitate but never copyright\nThey’re just imitation fillers while my literature stays genuine\nAll illegitimate posers attempts at insight\nPale in comparison to my my legitimate ledgers in time\n\nI’m often imitated but never duplicated\nI’m the word of God plus what Satan said\n\nThis is the balance of extremes\nForearms tattooed with pitchforks back tattooed with angel wings\n\nThis is what happens when fashion meets passion\nThis is the combination of everything and everything\nThis is it this is all\nI am infinitely everything\n\nSo why\nSo why\nWhy would I subject myself\nTo the same oppressions I’ve attempted to flee from?\n\nJustin Bieber echoes across the dance floor\n“Yeah is it too late to say I’m sorry now\nYeah I know I let you down\nIs it too late to say I’m sorry now?”\n\nAnd as cliche and cheesy as that sounds\nI get the chills because I know exactly what he was talking about\n\nAnd I wondered if anyone else in that club was an American Refugee\nI wondered if anyone else in that club knew what Biebs was saying\nOr if they were just dancing because of the beat\n\nAnd they were just seeing along\nBecause they thought that’s what they were supposed to do\nBecause most people have to be told what’s cool\nAnd force-fed that coolness until they have too many pairs of shoes\n\nNo amount of shoes will bring you real happiness\nAnd honestly I apologize\nWe Hollywoodians were put in a position to lead the Free World\nAnd everyone listened to us, you all listened to us\n\nYou gave us your ears and your hearts your souls and your minds\nAnd we gave you improbable dreams\nAnd glorious visions\nOf an unsustainable lifestyle that you’ll go broke trying to duplicate\n\nWhen will you realize\nYou can chase but never catch something that doesn’t really exist?\n\nAnd I’m sorry\nBut I give up I’m done because\n“Yeah I know once more that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I’m sorry now?”\n\nWhatever this thing is I believe it’s still here\nIt’s watching us right now…\n\nAnd I meditate on all of this\nRight here at this restaurant as they stare\nAn American Dream living legend\nIn a never-ending nefarious nightmare\n\nEating sushi\nIn the center at the top of the pyramid\nI told you before this is the life\nPoint, blank, pyramid\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 5: Tripping In Meditations\n\nYou can’t put a price on freedom we are all broken\nSpending money like it’s time tripping through this reality\nNo structures no rules no definites except that we all die\nAnd even that is debatable\n\nAnyone can argue anything\nRight or wrong there is no right or wrong\nRight or wrong there is no black or white\nThere is only an area of gray grander than the most grandiose Gray Whale\n\nGive me your pain\n\nA Skinwalker a shapeshifter a sorcerer an evil witch\nControl men’s minds and make them do all kinds of things\nIt uh assumes the shape of animals\nPuts on the skins and it has the power of those animals\nAnd it’s very serious stuff\nBecause if you mention a Skinwalker it comes for you\n\nGive me your pain\nGranted in g-forces\nCrash me into you\nCrash landing no demanding no requesting no 1st no 2nd guessing\nNo needing no freedom\nYou can’t put a price on freedom you can’t put a price on me\nAnd if you could you would find that that price would be totally free\n\nForget you\nForget me not\nForget forgetting you\nRemember you\nUntil forever turns into just memories\nUntil our bodies turn to dust\n\nUntil all that seems so artificially important\nBecomes insignificant relics of a distant past\n\nPast\nPass that over here whatever it is\nTonight there are no rules\nThere are no borders there are no limits there is only freedom\n\nUggh\n\nCan’t put a price on freedom\nWe are all broken\nSpending money like it’s time\nTripping through this reality\n\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me…\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 6: Lonely Tornado\n\nShe is\nShe is\nA natural phenomenon a beautiful creation\nShe is all

tornado\nAll defiance no alliance\nA rogue state no NATO\n\nShe is\nA wildfire a wildfire doesn’t ask for directions\nShe’s a real live wire\nA lucid dream a livid loose cannon\n\nShe pulls no punches and bars no holds\nShe acts on hunches and is always on the go\nAn amazing blaze in incredible ways\nShe is Dante’s Inferno\n\nAn altruistic angel and The Statue of Liberty’s flame\nSure she is a woman too but that is only by name\n\nShe is The Truth\nEven when she is a Liar\nShe is the epitome of the embodiment of\nA constructive destructive desire\n\nShe is\nThe message and the bottle the ocean and the storm\nShe is the function\nAnd she is the form\n\nA style all her won\nShe doesn’t even follow her own trends\nShe is the most beautiful tale ever written\nShe is the beginning of a mysterious plot she is the story that never ends\n\nShe falls in love and out\nAny inhibitions she releases them\nShe is the apple of my eye, she is the forbidden fruit\nAnd when she comes she comes to fruition\n\nShe is not led astray by anybody\nShe listens only to her own intuitions\nShe’s is the Kama she is the Sutra\nAnd she is all the positions\n\nShe is childlike cat like curiosity\nAnd ancient timeless wisdom\n\nWhen with her\nI feel love and trust\nI feel friendship\nI feel lust\n\nI feel life I feel death\nIt’s all the same differences\nHere now gone tomorrow\nLife is comprised of momentary instances\n\nSo what is the significance of anything with any significance\nIn fact to be exact what’s the significance of any of this\n\nShe is so much more than these words\nShe is so much more than these feelings\nShe is so much more than this world\nShe is so much more than the mirage in these meanings\n\nSo even when I write her the most amazing poems\nOr sing her the most amazing songs\nI still know any attempt to define her design is hopeless\nBecause no matter what I say or write\nWe all know a Natural Phenom is almost impossible to describe\n\nThere are no words in any language\nThat can do her majesticness true justice\nHer cardinal directions can not be defined\nNo matter how powerful the compass is\n\nSee she encompasses\nIn all honestness she herself is a hurricane\nShe is a Mommy Tsunami\nShe is a Stormy Torrential Rain\n\nShe is as desolate as the Mojave\nShe is all definites no probablies\n\nShe is a Fertile Earthquake\nA Vixenous Volcano\nHere in a whirlwind then gone in a flash\nShe is a Lonely Tornado\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 7: In Our Dreams\n\nYes\nYou were in my dreams again\nEven though we are on opposite sides of the world\nI swear in my dreams you are here\n\nAnd I don’t want to wake up\nI just want to lay here\nIn this world we created\nWhere we have our secret rendezvouses\n\nYes it seems like the world is ending\nThat World War 3 is imminent\nThat all our emotions are felt in vain\nAnd I don’t even care let it all burn up in brilliant light\n\nLet the bloodthirsty beasts be seduced by their own violence\nUntil they all explode\n\nYes this world is a crazy place\nThese days it seems there’s nowhere left where we can hide\nNowhere except here In our dreams\nWhere we have our secret rendezvouses\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 8: Hollywood Love Letters\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes you were in my dreams again\nEven though we are on opposite sides of the world\n\nAnd I swear in my dreams you are here\nAnd I don’t want to wake up\nI just want to lay here in this world we created\nWhere we have our secret rendezvouses\n\nWe are emotional refugees\nFleeing the abuses of our pasts\nIn hopes of a better life\nA place where we can breathe and be free\n\nYes we are all nostalgic for a time we never had\nHopeless romantics in love with the past\n\nAnd I know you are gone\nPossibly forever and know I’d do almost anything to get you back\nBack to the warm embrace of your lover\nBack to the bed where we dreamed these dreams undercover\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes you are the center of attention\nWherever you go people want to be near you\nEverything say people listen\nAnd yes many yearn for your touch\n\nBut you don’t want them to touch you\nYou only want me to touch you\nBut you only let them touch you\n\nYes you are sadly sadomasochistic\nStrangely addicted to those that lack love\nYou’d rather be objectified by total strangers\nThan unified with your equal because\n\nYou feel more comfortable having sex with a stranger\nThan hugging someone you really love\n\nLove\nWhat’s happened to us\nYou lost yourself in other people’s desires\nAnd I wasn’t man enough to fight back\n\nYes\n\nYes\nI ran away like I always have\nI ran away on a flight to the other side of the world\nAnd now the only time I see you\nIs in my dreams where we have our secret rendezvouses\n\nAnd you\nYou’re still stuck in that toxic Tinseltown of Hollywood\nWhere no one cares who you are they only care what you are\nFcking energy vampires sucking the life right out of you\n\nYes\n\nI guess\nWe can finally have a bit of peace thousands of miles from each other\nEven though we can’t run forever\nAnd we can run but we can’t hide from ourselves\n\nAnd no mountain is high enough\nNo ocean is deep enough\nNo land is wide enough\nNo wall is high enough to keep this flood of feelings away\n\nAway\n\nAway\nAwaaaaaaaaay\n\nYes\nI’ve tried everything to cleanse you from my consciousness\nI’ve tried yoga meditation drinking drugs sex and even suicide\nBut it seems the only thing that begins to help is writing these words\n\nAnd I write these words\nOh how I write these words\n\nWords to sentences\nSentences to paragraphs\nParagraphs to pages\nPages to chapters\nChapters to books\nBooks to anthologies\n\nYes\n\nI’ve written the largest collection of poetry ever written\nI’ve written about everything\nStill it feels like I haven’t said a thing\nJust another heartbroken kid lost trying to find, his way, home\n\nAnd I want to get all this through to you\n\nBut you’re too caught up\n\nIn Facebook updates\nSnapchat vids\nInstagram likes\nTwitter tweets\n\nI just wish you’d look up and see me again\nAnd remember what it was like to be free and loved\nAnd you say I don’t care\nBut it’s just that I don’t care about those that don’t care about us\n\nYes\nYes\nYes you were in my dreams again\nEven though we are on opposite sides of the world\n\nI swear in my dreams you are here\nAnd I don’t want to wake up\nI just want to lay here in this world we’ve created\nWhere we have our secret rendezvouses\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 9: Butterflies, Landmines, Monsters, Mobsters\n\nFeeling like a butterfly in a hurricane\nFeeling like this moment is forever even though I may never see her again\n\nSee\n\nJust when you think you’re on stable ground\nThe earth shakes and you get caught in a landslide\nAnd just when you think you’re finally back on your feet\nYou walk outside and step on a landmine\n\nIt all seems way too chaotic\nAnd the war drums all sound hypnotic\nAnd the soldiers all seem robotic\nSomehow this scene all seems similar and symbolic\n\nWe’re monsters and mobsters\nGrey Goose vodka with guava\nAll of us are monsters slash mobsters\nWell dressed our recipe

stop\nNo periods just commas\n\nSipping\nGrey Goose vodka and guava\nPartying at the top of the top\nWith monsters slash mobsters\n\nAnd it all seems way too chaotic\nAnd the war drums all sound

theirs or something\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed\nIs the masses have to be told what’s cool\nLike kids have to be taught the rules\nLike “Look man I play yeah\nBut don’t ever think you can play me like a fool.”\n\nTools\nOf the trade\nAces\nShovels and spades\n\nThese are the days\nThe end of days\nThe last days\nOf The Glory of Man\n\nAnd I’m on a tangent again\nAt a pageant with friends\nPrincess

cigarettes\nPromiscuous girls wanna date me\nBut only for a night and then a day of regrets\n\nEating sushi\nIn the center at the top of the pyramid\nThis is the life\nPoint blank period\n\nHamachi ahi\nUni unagi\nWe eat everything\nUp until the last big fish in all the 7 seas\n\n7 seas 7 sins at the table gambling’\nWash it all down with all green everything\nGreen dollars green grass green eyes green tea\nFrom poor to rich tables turn lights switch look how the pendulum swings\n\nIt's 113 degrees here in Sin City\nCan we at least admit that something's wrong\nThe mass media is an encyclopedia of trivial distractions\nSame old dance and song\n\nWho cares about a couple of convicts or the size of Lebron's d!ck\nWe're all lost at sea and can't see the coming storm\n\nA night was had dancing music flirting new friends\nWe're all in it together a glorious moment with people from all over the world\n\nWe were on top of the world\nSurfin on a rocket on cloud 9 with some fine felines\nBumping beats with a pocket full of sunshine\nFlashing lights and flashy ladies\nDrinks on me\nNo, literally, \"drink's on me.”\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 2: Top of The Pyramid\n\nEating sushi in the center at the top of the pyramid\nThis is the life point blank pyramid\nBuilt on the back of high hopes and low self esteem\nWhere every game is fixed and sits upon a million broken dreams\n\nSee\nI've seen a man lose everything due to his greed\nIn the passionate pursuit of his wants\nHe seemed to have lost all his necessary needs\n\nSee\nThis is Vegas baby\nWhere bad things seem good\nAnd good things seem shady\n\nThough luckily\nI've mastered the art of the sin\nSo I rarely play\nAnd when I do I play to win\n\nLoaded dice cards up my sleeve\nI know the dealer plus I paid off the magician\n\nFor I am one of those that made it\nTo the top of the pyramid\nSo now I sit in a penthouse suite with a sweet freak between my sheets at the Luxor\nI told you before this is the life point blank pyramid\n\nHahahahaha\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps\n\nCalifornia draught Texas floods\nPossessive lust disguised as love\nDisgusted but what can any of us do about it\nThe truth is we've got to stop talking and be about it\n\nAnd that is the fundamental problem\n\nPlus Luciferian false prophets profess hedonistic linguistics\nOn various obsolete topics\nAs artificial mystics with marketable gimmicks\nBreak the rules and the lines of scrimmage\n\nThis is serious in all seriousness\n\nStill we try to ignore it all and fill in the hole with alcohol and other various intoxicants\n\nThat is the elephant in the room\nWe are all consumers consumed\nWe are slaves that dig our own graves\nAnd build our own tombs\n\nWe can Tivo a TV show and that can be saved\nBut we can not seem to save our own souls\nMy heart has some holes\n\nNo clouds in LA just that ominous haze\n113 degrees in the shade\nAs the Luciferian prophets are praised\nAnd we don't care about the world as long as we're getting paid\n\nOnly when the last tree has died\nThe last river has been poisoned\nAnd the last fish has been caught\nWill we realize we can't eat money\n\nAnd we know all of this deep within ourselves\nThat's why we feel uneasy and anxious\nBecause we have no one left to blame but ourselves\n\nSo we log onto Facebook\nSearching for some kind of company and salvation\nSome words to guide us and pass the time\nSome voyeuristic advice and definitive direction\n\nBut the revolution won't be televised\nOnline on the internet what do we really find\nJust words and some pictures\nHumankind homogenized\n\nAnd infidel idols idolized\nWhile copycat killers copyright what was one ritualized\nAnd what's left of Mother Nature becomes industrialized\nHot as Hell still the temperature continues to rise\n\nIt's 113 degrees here in Sin City\nCan we at least admit that something's wrong\nThe mass media is an encyclopedia of trivial distractions\nSame old dance and song\n\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps\nHead feels like a ton of bricks\nTrying to retrace my mis-stepped steps!\n\nWill anyone go with me?\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 3: Exodus\n\nI came to this country to escape Hollywood\nWhere I was trapped in its trapped trappings\n\nTrapped in its clubs\nTrapped in its women\nTrapped in its drugs\nTrapped in its cliches\n\nSo why is it I find myself on the other side of the world\nAt a club with some women on drugs trapped in the same cliches?\n\nSame sh!t different country\n\nI guess you can take boy outta LA\nBut you can’t take the LA outta the boy\n\nI am the world’s first American refugee\n\nExcept I didn’t come on a boat in ragged clothes clinging to my body\nAnd ragged hopes clinging to my psyche\nI came on a plane in a 1st class seat\nDining on offering of a corporate world wide empire\n\nBut it is not the means of a movement\nIt is the intentions behind the actions that matter\n\nAnd I came with the intentions to create a healthier life\nA cleaner life\nA better future for myself and all those that I love\n\nI am an American Refugee\nI am an American Refugee\nFleeing the subconscious oppressions of my country\nFleeing the persecutions of all things I hold holy and sacred\n\nI am tired of witnessing the spiritual martyr of my failing comrades\n\nI am an American Refugee more specifically a Hollywood refugee\nFleeing the bright lights and large egos\nSearching for solace and refuge\nAmongst the towering rainforest trees of New Zealand\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 4: Love Sex Magic\n\nAs I soak my bruised bones and my blood diamonds\nIn a bubble bath of passionfruit and guava\nThis is no joke I exude the good life without even trying\nMy karma mixed with my commas brought me to Nirvana\n\nNo Kurt Cobain\nJust hurt and pain mixed up with this money made me a monster\nNo Meek Mills or weak wills\nJust a Student from School of Hard Knocks who graduated with honors\n\nSomehow\nSo now I’m swimming in endorphins with a princess no tiara\nNo tomorrow no time to borrow\nAnd I bet we’re gonna make Love Sex Magic no Future or Ciara\n\nThat’s a pop reference if you didn’t get it\nYeah Future Ciara I Bet Love Sex Magic trick or treat\n\nSee there’s a ton of puns\nAnd subliminals in almost every line I write\nSometimes the sublime subliminals are so subtle\nThat I don’t even catch them they escape no alibis\n\nCopycat killers can imitate but never copyright\nThey’re just imitation fillers while my literature stays genuine\nAll illegitimate posers attempts at insight\nPale in comparison to my my legitimate ledgers in time\n\nI’m often imitated but never duplicated\nI’m the word of God plus what Satan said\n\nThis is the balance of extremes\nForearms tattooed with pitchforks back tattooed with angel wings\n\nThis is what happens when fashion meets passion\nThis is the combination of everything and everything\nThis is it this is all\nI am infinitely everything\n\nSo why\nSo why\nWhy would I subject myself\nTo the same oppressions I’ve attempted to flee from?\n\nJustin Bieber echoes across the dance floor\n“Yeah is it too late to say I’m sorry now\nYeah I know I let you down\nIs it too late to say I’m sorry now?”\n\nAnd as cliche and cheesy as that sounds\nI get the chills because I know exactly what he was talking about\n\nAnd I wondered if anyone else in that club was an American Refugee\nI wondered if anyone else in that club knew what Biebs was saying\nOr if they were just dancing because of the beat\n\nAnd they were just seeing along\nBecause they thought that’s what they were supposed to do\nBecause most people have to be told what’s cool\nAnd force-fed that coolness until they have too many pairs of shoes\n\nNo amount of shoes will bring you real happiness\nAnd honestly I apologize\nWe Hollywoodians were put in a position to lead the Free World\nAnd everyone listened to us, you all listened to us\n\nYou gave us your ears and your hearts your souls and your minds\nAnd we gave you improbable dreams\nAnd glorious visions\nOf an unsustainable lifestyle that you’ll go broke trying to duplicate\n\nWhen will you realize\nYou can chase but never catch something that doesn’t really exist?\n\nAnd I’m sorry\nBut I give up I’m done because\n“Yeah I know once more that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I’m sorry now?”\n\nWhatever this thing is I believe it’s still here\nIt’s watching us right now…\n\nAnd I meditate on all of this\nRight here at this restaurant as they stare\nAn American Dream living legend\nIn a never-ending nefarious nightmare\n\nEating sushi\nIn the center at the top of the pyramid\nI told you before this is the life\nPoint, blank, pyramid\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 5: Tripping In Meditations\n\nYou can’t put a price on freedom we are all broken\nSpending money like it’s time tripping through this reality\nNo structures no rules no definites except that we all die\nAnd even that is debatable\n\nAnyone can argue anything\nRight or wrong there is no right or wrong\nRight or wrong there is no black or white\nThere is only an area of gray grander than the most grandiose Gray Whale\n\nGive me your pain\n\nA Skinwalker a shapeshifter a sorcerer an evil witch\nControl men’s minds and make them do all kinds of things\nIt uh assumes the shape of animals\nPuts on the skins and it has the power of those animals\nAnd it’s very serious stuff\nBecause if you mention a Skinwalker it comes for you\n\nGive me your pain\nGranted in g-forces\nCrash me into you\nCrash landing no demanding no requesting no 1st no 2nd guessing\nNo needing no freedom\nYou can’t put a price on freedom you can’t put a price on me\nAnd if you could you would find that that price would be totally free\n\nForget you\nForget me not\nForget forgetting you\nRemember you\nUntil forever turns into just memories\nUntil our bodies turn to dust\n\nUntil all that seems so artificially important\nBecomes insignificant relics of a distant past\n\nPast\nPass that over here whatever it is\nTonight there are no rules\nThere are no borders there are no limits there is only freedom\n\nUggh\n\nCan’t put a price on freedom\nWe are all broken\nSpending money like it’s time\nTripping through this reality\n\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me\nTake this trip with me…\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 6: Lonely Tornado\n\nShe is\nShe is\nA natural phenomenon a beautiful creation\nShe is all journey with no

ancient timeless wisdom\n\nWhen with her\nI feel love and trust\nI feel friendship\nI feel lust\n\nI feel life I feel death\nIt’s all the same differences\nHere now gone tomorrow\nLife is comprised of momentary instances\n\nSo what is the significance of anything with any significance\nIn fact to be exact what’s the significance of any of this\n\nShe is so much more than these words\nShe is so much more than these feelings\nShe is so much more than this world\nShe is so much more than the mirage in these meanings\n\nSo even when I write her the most amazing poems\nOr sing her the most amazing songs\nI still know any attempt to define her design is hopeless\nBecause no matter what I say or write\nWe all know a Natural Phenom is almost impossible to describe\n\nThere are no words in any language\nThat can do her majesticness true justice\nHer cardinal directions can not be defined\nNo matter how powerful the compass is\n\nSee she encompasses\nIn all honestness she herself is a

get you back\nBack to the warm embrace of your lover\nBack to the bed where we dreamed these dreams undercover\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes you are the center of attention\nWherever you go people want to be near you\nEverything say people listen\nAnd yes many yearn for your touch\n\nBut you don’t want them to touch you\nYou only want me to touch you\nBut you only let them touch you\n\nYes you are sadly sadomasochistic\nStrangely addicted to those that lack love\nYou’d rather be objectified by total strangers\nThan unified with your equal because\n\nYou feel more comfortable having sex with a stranger\nThan hugging someone you really love\n\nLove\nWhat’s happened to us\nYou lost yourself in other people’s desires\nAnd I wasn’t man enough to fight back\n\nYes\n\nYes\nI ran away like I always have\nI ran away on a flight to the other side of the world\nAnd now the only time I see you\nIs in my dreams where we have our secret rendezvouses\n\nAnd you\nYou’re still stuck in that toxic

thousands of miles from each other\nEven though we can’t run forever\nAnd we can run but we can’t hide from ourselves\n\nAnd no mountain is high enough\nNo ocean is deep enough\nNo land is wide enough\nNo wall is high enough to keep this flood of feelings away\n\nAway\n\nAway\nAwaaaaaaaaay\n\nYes\nI’ve tried everything to cleanse you from my consciousness\nI’ve tried yoga meditation drinking drugs sex and even suicide\nBut it seems the only thing that begins to help is writing these words\n\nAnd I write these words\nOh how I write these words\n\nWords to sentences\nSentences to paragraphs\nParagraphs to pages\nPages to chapters\nChapters to books\nBooks to anthologies\n\nYes\n\nI’ve written the largest collection of poetry ever written\nI’ve written about everything\nStill it feels like I haven’t said a thing\nJust another heartbroken kid lost trying to find, his way, home\n\nAnd I want to get all this through to you\n\nBut you’re too caught up\n\nIn Facebook updates\nSnapchat vids\nInstagram likes\nTwitter tweets\n\nI just wish you’d look up and see me again\nAnd remember what it was like to be free and loved\nAnd you say I don’t care\nBut it’s just that I don’t care about those that don’t care about us\n\nYes\nYes\nYes you were in my dreams again\nEven though we are on opposite sides of the world\n\nI swear in my dreams you are here\nAnd I don’t want

landslide\nAnd just when you think you’re finally back on your feet\nYou walk outside and step on a landmine\n\nIt all seems way too chaotic\nAnd the war drums all sound hypnotic\nAnd the soldiers all seem robotic\nSomehow this scene all seems similar and symbolic\n\nWe’re monsters and mobsters\nGrey Goose vodka with guava\nAll of us are monsters slash mobsters\nWell dressed our recipe conquers\n\nHonest\nNo lies although I might conceal truths\nThe truth\nIs the rest of you just pay dues\n\nCan't find me where they find you\nPoint A to Point B we break banks sky high IQs\nWhy try and test I you retire and say bye bye\nIf you knew what I know about you\n\nPoint A to Point B\nI C through these D-eceitful ones\nIt’s all E-energy\nThey want the keys to the kingdom but they lack the funds\n\nDumdums\nWeighed down with dumbbells\nThe only thing they run\nIs themselves in a hamster wheel\n\nThey’re just peasants\nOur bloodlines are imperial\n\nSo tell me what the difference

what you thought\n\nListen\nThe code is in the music\nThe codex we use it\nKodak picture perfect trueness\n\nLost in my own thoughts\nLost in the crown\nAt the top of the top of the pyramid\nI watch it all like a wise old owl\n\nFrom 44th floor balconies\nChampagne and cocaine\nThe alchemy of all things\nIn a 4 story penthouse\nPartying with people that own airplanes\nThat’s plural\nOwners of airlines and airwaves\nNot just one Learjet 60 but entire airlines\n\nAnything we want we acquire quickly\nSet deadlines and control headlines\nI can’t believe these disparities\nBut I must leave it all up to sincerity\n\nHonestly\nThis is a lesson in dualities\nYou must have these extremes to be blessed with all these luxuries\nG-O-D is our Holy Trilogy\n\nAnd all these thoughts come to me\nAs I stand out on a 44th floor balcony\nFrom here this entire dirty city looks so pretty\nWith a model sipping a vodka cranberry\n\nTrippin on my own thoughts\nThey overflow like lava\nBut we won’t stop\nNo periods just commas\n\nSipping\nGrey Goose vodka and guava\nPartying at the top of the top\nWith monsters slash mobsters\n\nAnd it all seems way too chaotic\nAnd the war drums all sound hypnotic\nAnd the soldiers all seem robotic\nSomehow this scene all seems similar and symbolic..\n\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\n\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 10: The Glory of Man\n\nI am amazing\nPlease no don’t blame my ego for that statement\nI’m just a Realist\nSo I understand my societal placement\n\nSee these are the days\nThe last days of The Glory of Man\nSo tell me your story\nStand up give me your hand\n\nNo plan\nBut lots of planning\nNo fans\nBut lots of fanning\nOkay some fans\nSome stalkers with awkward comments too that deserve flagging\nBut no spam no

landing\n\nStill I see them stare\nAmused by the potential plane train wreck\n\nThey’re on the sidelines\nCheering and chanting\n\n“Go, go, go!”\n\nLike they’re on my team or something\nOr I’m on theirs or something\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed\nIs the masses have to be told what’s cool\nLike kids have to be taught the rules\nLike “Look man I play yeah\nBut don’t ever think you can play me like a fool.”\n\nTools\nOf the trade\nAces\nShovels and spades\n\nThese are the days\nThe end of days\nThe last days\nOf The Glory of Man\n\nAnd I’m on a tangent again\nAt a pageant with friends\nPrincess waving\nAnd shaking hands\n\nPoliticking with these fridges pigeons\nWearing a clown crown and a spray tan\nFck that\nWearing a backwards ball cap holding a spray can\n\nNo Ray-Bans\nSo you can see my both of my eyeballs fam\nSee this whole pageant\nIs beginning to feel like a damn scam\n\nI don’t know who these people are\nOr where these damn fans ran from\nBut goddamnit I know who I am\nI am amazing\n\nAnd no please don’t blame my ego for that statement\nI’m just a realist so I understand my societal placement\nSee these days are the last days of The Glory of Man\nSo get what you can still get while you still can\n\n\nAmerican Refugee Part 10: Fire Fights\n\nShips passing in the night\nWhatever to get my mind right\nWhatever to numb the pain\nTo take the edge away from me\n\nTake

right\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nBut did you know that I loved you?\nOr were you not aware?\nYou're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere\nI'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile\nI've been wanting to tell you this for a long while\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's gonna make you fall in love?\nI know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart\nDon't have to be scared at all, oh, my

I guess it’s time for me to say\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat I got eyes for you baby\nI want us to be together\nAnd if you feel it too\nTell me no one will treat you better\n\n[Chorus]\nCause on nights like this\nIt’s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this\nThe more and more you feel like you can live your life like this\nAnd then you say, hope this will last forever\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon’t know if it's love, it's too early to say\nBut if it’s something like it, I just want it to remain\nDon’t know if you’re the one that takes a little time\nBut in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine\nCause the way you look at me never seen that look before\nAnd if it’s a hint of what’s to come then baby can I get some more\nNot tryna be too forward\nBut I think it’s best for you to know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat I got eyes for you baby\nI want us to be together\nAnd if you feel it too\nTell me no one will treat you better\n\n[Chorus]\nCause on nights like this\nIt’s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this\nThe more and more you feel like you can live your life like this\nAnd then you say, hope this will last forever\n\n[Bridge]\nI think I found my girl, if

break your heart too\nAnd I'm always tired but never of you\n\n[Closer: Halsey]\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car\nAnd four years, no call\nNow I'm lookin' pretty in

Next he plays “Happier When We’re Together,” a ballad in which he worries a girlfriend will be unfaithful while he’s on tour. Standing up as his own beatboxing merges seamlessly with a drum machine at the beginning of “You’re the One,” he does an impromptu variation of the Moonwalk\n\nOne can forgive him for the victory dance. Since his debut three years ago Bieber has sold 15 million albums, grossing $150 million on 157 tour dates across two dozen countries along the way. His biopic, Never Say Never, pulled in $30 million on its opening weekend, just shy of the ­concert-film record, and racked up $100 million at the box office in total. His fragrance, Someday, debuted last June and did $60 million in retail sales during its first six months on the market. Those income streams helped Bieber personally earn an estimated $55 million over the past 12 months and $108 million over the past two years\n\n“You have humans, and you have aliens,” says veteran hitmaker Timothy “Timbaland” Mosley, one of the producers on Believe. “I think he’s half-human and half-alien.”\n\nEven more impressive than Bieber’s earning power: his vast social media reach, part of the reason he ranks third on this year’s Celebrity 100 list. Bieber boasts 21 million Twitter followers—more than any person on Earth not named Lady Gaga. His 43 million Facebook fans are more than Mitt Romney’s and Barack Obama’s put together. With 740 million views, his breakout ballad, “Baby,” is the most-watched video in YouTube history; if you assume three minutes per song, his VEVO channel’s 2.4 billion impressions are enough to provide one minute of video to every person on the planet\n\nBieber’s influence and moneymaking talents are fairly well established. It’s far more surprising what he’s doing with that cash. He provides a hint in the dim octagonal recording studio, owned by Rodney Jerkins, who had a hand in many of Michael Jackson’s late-career hits and is now producing songs for Believe. His dancing done, Bieber quickly settles into a chair behind a keyboard. Inspiration has struck: He starts tapping out a fresh beat, as comfortable with the sophisticated equipment as a pop star a generation earlier would be strumming a rhythm guitar. “Can you loop that, what I did?” he asks the engineer at one point. Bieber eventually turns to me: “The tech aspect is just fun for me.”\n\nBieber’s tech savvy infuses more than his music—it’s also a core strategy for how the entertainer intends to translate all that fame and fast money into enduring riches. Instinctively, he embraces a Peter Lynch model of investing—“I’m not going to invest in something I don’t like; I have to believe in the product”—but rather than load up on buy-what-you-know value stocks, the singer has been quietly plowing millions into private tech startups. According to his manager, Bieber holds stakes in a dozen such companies. FORBES was able to verify four: messaging platform Tinychat, social-­curation app Stamped, gaming outfit Sojo Studios and, most critically, Spot­i­fy, the disruptive music service founded by Daniel Ek and backed by everyone from Sean Parker to Li Ka-shing\n\nBieber has come a long way in the finance department since I first broached the subject with him a bit over a year ago. “I have a business manager,” he told me at the 2011 Grammys. “That basically sums up the question.” Today that’s changed: “I do calls every week with my business manager and my lawyer,” he says. “Each week I’m learning something about my business and what I need to know for my career.”\n\nYet the core truth of last year’s statement remains. Bieber is still a cocky, jokey teenager who, rightfully, thinks he has the world by the short hairs. His eye for technology and trends ultimately determines the go or no-go—and some of the investments have come through his own contacts—but the guy actively scouting deals, whether venture capital investments or brand extensions, has a nickname worthy of a teen idol’s manager: Scott Braun, known to all as Scooter. “We’re always looking for the next thing,” he says. “If we’re coming in and putting his name to something, and his brand and likeness and his social media power, then we will try and figure out a proper compensation.”\n\nThe story of how Braun discovered Bieber four years ago became so immediately legendary that the latter is loath to go there. “You want me to tell you how I got started, bro?” complains Bieber, before relenting. “I really don’t want to.”\n\nBieber grew up in Stratford, Ont., a town of 30,000 two hours west of Toronto. His mother was 18 when she gave birth to her only child, and she raised him mostly by herself in state-subsidized housing. “Yellow shag carpets,” he remembers, “and we had mice.”\n\nHe quickly saturated those carpets with sound waves, teaching himself to play drums, trumpet, piano and guitar. At age 12 he earned second place in a local talent competition for his rendition of Ne-Yo’s “So Sick.” His mother posted videos of his performance on YouTube for friends who couldn’t make the show; soon she was regularly uploading videos of her son covering soul songs\nYou might also likeAround the same time, Braun was doubling as an Atlanta party promoter and a small-time music industry executive. When singer Akon asked him to research an unrelated YouTube sensation, Braun accidentally came across one of Bieber’s videos—a nine-figure misclick. Astonished by the youngster’s tone and range, Braun tracked down Bieber’s mother and offered to fly her and her son to Atlanta to sing for him and R&B crooner Usher\n\n“It was just crazy to me because I didn’t really think that it was possible,” Bieber says. “I lived in such a small town and things like that didn’t really happen.” Before Web 2.0 they probably never did. Yet there was Bieber, blowing away Braun and Usher in March 2008. The duo quickly signed him to their joint venture, Raymond Braun Media Group, and Braun became Bieber’s manager. By September they’d landed him a record deal with Universal Music Group’s Island Def Jam. His first single cracked the top 20 after its July 2009 release, and his debut EP, My World, catapulted him to mainstream fame that fall. In December President Obama invited him to sing at the White House, and he wowed a national audience with a per­for­mance on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve\n\nThis cultural phenomenon, born of social media, took a modicum of fame and tossed it into the digital echo chamber. Bieber opened a Twitter account in June 2009 and by September had amassed 1 million followers. (In 2010 a Twitter employee said 3% of the company’s infrastructure was dedicated to handling Bieber-related tweets.) He was also an early adopter of Instagram, the photo-sharing service recently purchased by Facebook for $1 billion, and boasts 1.5 million followers there, more than any other user (his girlfriend, singer/actress Selena Gomez, ranks third with 1.4 million)\n\n“It used to be there was a mystery to the artist,” says Bieber. “Now there’s, like, no mystery—the fans want the connection, they want to see you Instagramming at a coffee shop in the morning.”\n\nWith such social media dexterity Bieber has built himself a formidable platform. The 30-year-old Braun’s challenge: sustaining the phenomenon. In many ways Bieber and Braun are the most intriguing talent-manager combo since Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker. Both managers wielded the influence that comes from discovering their charges young, and both faced the challenge of moving them past the fickle market of hysterical, screaming teenage girls\n\nBut whereas Parker took any deal he could and up to 50% of the action to make sure his once-in-a-lifetime meal ticket turned into a decades-long feast, Braun is more judicious. His deal with Bieber is closer to the standard 15%; he thinks long-term success requires selectivity, not ubiquity, and aligning all deals with Bieber’s brand. “I don’t let him get involved in anything unless he likes it,” he says. Turning Bieber into the world’s most unconventional venture capitalist is simply a sophisticated manifestation of that philosophyEmbed\nThis story appeared on the June 4, 2012 cover of Forbes\n\nLeaning on a soundboard in a Hollywood recording studio, Justin Bieber is about to make me an offer that would prompt instant hysteria among millions of American teenage girls: Do I want to be the first person outside of his inner circle to hear some rough cuts he’s considering for his upcoming album, Believe?\n\n“You’ve gotta hear this, it’s crazy,” gushes the singer. “It’s called ‘Die in Your Arms.’” A moment later his ubiquitous lilt surges full volume from the stadium-quality speakers, a soulful love song reminiscent of early Jackson 5.

His eye for technology and trends ultimately determines the go or no-go—and some of the investments have come through his own contacts—but the guy actively scouting deals, whether venture capital investments or brand extensions, has a nickname worthy of a teen idol’s manager: Scott Braun, known to all as Scooter. “We’re always looking for the next thing,” he says. “If we’re coming in and putting his name to something, and his brand and likeness and his social media power, then we will try and figure out a proper compensation.”\n\nThe story of how Braun discovered Bieber four years ago became so immediately legendary that the latter is loath to go there. “You want me to tell you how I got started, bro?” complains Bieber, before relenting. “I really don’t want to.”\n\nBieber grew up in Stratford, Ont., a town of 30,000 two hours west of Toronto. His mother was 18 when she gave birth to her only child, and she raised him mostly by herself in state-subsidized housing. “Yellow shag carpets,” he remembers, “and we had mice.”\n\nHe quickly saturated those carpets with sound waves, teaching himself to play drums, trumpet, piano and guitar. At age 12 he earned second place in a local talent competition for his rendition of Ne-Yo’s “So Sick.” His mother posted videos of his performance on YouTube for friends who couldn’t make the show; soon she was regularly uploading videos of her son covering soul songs\n\nAround the same time, Braun was doubling as an Atlanta party promoter and a small-time music industry executive. When singer Akon asked him to research an unrelated YouTube sensation, Braun accidentally came across one of Bieber’s videos—a nine-figure misclick. Astonished by the youngster’s tone and range, Braun tracked down Bieber’s mother and offered to fly her and her son to Atlanta to sing for him and R&B crooner Usher\n\n“It was just crazy to me because I didn’t really think that it was possible,” Bieber says. “I lived in such a small town and things like that didn’t really happen.” Before Web 2.0 they probably never did. Yet there was Bieber, blowing away Braun and Usher in March 2008. The duo quickly signed him to their joint venture, Raymond Braun Media Group, and Braun became Bieber’s manager. By September they’d landed him a record deal with Universal Music Group’s Island Def Jam. His first single cracked the top 20 after its July 2009 release, and his debut EP, My World, catapulted him to mainstream fame that fall. In December President Obama invited him to sing at the White House, and he wowed a national audience with a per­for­mance on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve\n\nThis cultural phenomenon, born of social media, took a modicum of fame and tossed it into the digital echo chamber. Bieber opened a Twitter account in June 2009 and by September had amassed 1 million followers. (In 2010 a Twitter employee said 3% of the company’s infrastructure was dedicated to handling Bieber-related tweets.) He was also an early adopter of Instagram, the photo-sharing service recently purchased by Facebook for $1 billion, and boasts 1.5 million followers there, more than any other user (his girlfriend, singer/actress Selena Gomez, ranks third with 1.4 million)\n\n“It used to be there was a mystery to the artist,” says Bieber. “Now there’s, like, no mystery—the fans want the connection, they want to see you Instagramming at a coffee shop in the morning.”\n\nWith such social media dexterity Bieber has built himself a formidable platform. The 30-year-old Braun’s challenge: sustaining the phenomenon. In many ways Bieber and Braun are the most intriguing talent-manager combo since Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker. Both managers wielded the influence that comes from discovering their charges young, and both faced the challenge of moving them past the fickle market of hysterical, screaming teenage girls\n\nBut whereas Parker took any deal he could and up to 50% of the action to make sure his once-in-a-lifetime meal ticket turned into a decades-long feast, Braun is more judicious. His deal with Bieber is closer to the standard 15%; he thinks long-term success requires selectivity, not ubiquity, and aligning all deals with Bieber’s brand. “I don’t let him get involved in anything unless he likes it,” he says. Turning Bieber into the world’s most unconventional venture capitalist is simply a sophisticated manifestation of that philosophy"}, {"title": "Just Like Them", "lyrics": "18 ContributorsJust Like Them Lyrics[Intro]\nI know it’s hard but, you know\nLet’s go\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere’s something different in your eyes baby\nYou can’t seem to look into mine lately\nTell me what is on your mind baby\nOr I'm gon' assume that something’s wrong\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\n'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not really tripping, I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know that it’s hard to trust love\nBut you need the trust that my love\nWill never leave you in the dust\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\nCause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby can we keep this love on track?\nWe can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back\nYou know that I love you girl so tell me what you’re waiting for?\nYou gotta know know know know\nKnow know know know know know\nKnow know know know know know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\nCause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them3Embed\n[Intro]\nI know it’s hard but, you know\nLet’s go\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere’s something different in your eyes baby\nYou can’t seem to look into mine lately\nTell me what is on your mind baby\nOr I'm gon' assume that something’s wrong\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\n'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not really tripping, I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know that it’s hard to trust love\nBut you need the trust that my love\nWill never leave you in the dust\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\nCause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby can we keep this love on track?\nWe can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back\nYou know that I love you girl so tell me what you’re waiting for?\nYou gotta know know know know\nKnow know know know know know\nKnow know know know know know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed\nCause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived\nAnd I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don’t tell me you’re just like them\nYou’re just like them"}, {"title": "Ketchup Relish", "lyrics": "3 ContributorsKetchup Relish Lyrics[Intro: Justin Bieber]\nOh-woah (Woah-woah)\nOh-woah (Yeah)\nOh-woah (Woah-woah)\nOh-woah (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]\nI think I'm in a transition (Shh, woo)\nBaby, don't talk, just listen (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou ain't with me unless you see the vision (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nTalking relationship, don't need religion\nI think I'm over-overwhelming (Woah-woah)\nAnd I know I'm over-overselling (Yo)\nHigh, high, high\nNo-no-no repelling\nI'm a fly guy and I don't embellish\nNo, I don't embellish\nYeah, you need the ketchup relish\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nKetchup (Ketchup)\nYou must have fucked up some ketchup (Mustard)\nI iced her down from the neck up\nTold her, \"Bless up\" (Blеss up), bless up (Bless up)\nI'm the huncho (Yеssir)\nI can take you through the highs and lows (Highs and lows)\nPrivate plane goin' to Mexico (Mexico)\nBig drip on the private boat (Splash)\nYou the only one to see this, like a UFO (Yeah)\nI'll be the only one you need, don't take this personal (No)\nYou know confidence is key, how you feelin' bold (Bold)\nRelatinship like plenty seeds, we 'sposed to grow (Grow)\nI thought you'd know (I thought you'd know)\nSkrrt off in that Lambo' and then we sittin' low\nFocused on that green like I'm Piccolo\nWhen we get between the sheets, let's go sicko mode\nBody and soul, out of control\nYou might also like[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nIt feels like forever since the season now, yeah\nCan I take my arms?

see what's going on\nBut now I know I'm better sleeping on my own\n\n[Chorus: Conor Maynard]\n'Cause if you like the way you look that much\nThen baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to something\nYou should go and love yourself\n\n[Verse 3: Anth]\nGood days, better nights\nNo stress, no fights\nCold drinks, city lights\nThis is what I used to call the good life\nHah, and now I tell myself\nStaring at my cell phone just won't help\nKeeping all the clothes on my top left shelf\nIs only gonna keep me in this hell, oh well\nSo wow, stumble at the hotel lobby\nLooking for a cab to the afterparty\nTryna fit five girls in the back\nThe only thing on my mind is where the hell you at\nAre you with your new man?\nFuck, drink drink\nAre you making new plans?\nFuck, drink drink\nBottles 'til I can't stand, can't think, think\nI can't think, can't think\n\n[Outro: Conor Maynard]\nSo you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans\nHolding me
